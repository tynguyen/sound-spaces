SoundSpaces is a realistic acoustic simulation platform for audio-visual embodied AI research. From audio-visual navigation, audio-visual exploration to echolocation and audio-visual floor plan reconstruction, this platform expands embodied vision research to a broader scope of topics.

## Motivation
Moving around in the world is naturally a multisensory experience, but today's embodied agents are deaf---restricted to solely their visual perception of the environment. We introduce audio-visual navigation for complex, acoustically and visually realistic 3D environments. We further build *SoundSpaces*: a first-of-its-kind dataset of audio renderings based on geometrical acoustic simulations for two sets of publicly available 3D environments (Matterport3D and Replica), and we instrument [Habitat](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-api/blob/master/README.md) to support the new sensor, making it possible to insert arbitrary sound sources in an array of real-world scanned environments.

## Citing SoundSpaces
If you use the SoundSpaces platform in your research, please cite the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11474.pdf):
```

  author    =     {Changan Chen and Unnat Jain and Carl Schissler and Sebastia Vicenc Amengual Gari and Ziad Al-Halah and Vamsi Krishna Ithapu and Philip Robinson and Kristen Grauman},

}
```

## Installation
1. Install [habitat-lab v0.1.7](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab) and [habitat-sim v0.1.7](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim)
2. Install this repo into pip by running the following command:
```
pip install -e .
```
3. Following instructions on the [dataset](soundspaces/README.md) page to download the rendered audio data and datasets


## Debug
### Error 1
“ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26'”.

Solution:
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 sudo apt-get upgrade libstdc++6
You can check if you get GLIBCXX desired version like this:
strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX
```


## Usage
This repo supports benchmarking PointGoal, AudioGoal and AudioPointGoal on Replica and Matterport3D datasets.
We provide several baselines including a mapless end-to-end RL agent and a hierarchical model.

Below we show the commands for training and evaluating AudioGoal with Depth sensor on Replica,
but it applies to the other two tasks, other sensors and Matterport dataset as well.
1. Training
```
python ss_baselines/av_nav/run.py --exp-config ss_baselines/av_nav/config/audionav/replica/train_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth
```
2. Validation (evaluate each checkpoint and generate a validation curve)
```
python ss_baselines/av_nav/run.py --run-type eval --exp-config ss_baselines/av_nav/config/audionav/replica/val_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth
```
3. Test the best validation checkpoint based on validation curve
```
python ss_baselines/av_nav/run.py --run-type eval --exp-config ss_baselines/av_nav/config/audionav/replica/test_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth EVAL_CKPT_PATH_DIR data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth/data/ckpt.XXX.pth
```
4. Generate demo video with audio
```
python ss_baselines/av_nav/run.py --run-type eval --exp-config ss_baselines/av_nav/config/audionav/replica/test_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth EVAL_CKPT_PATH_DIR data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth/data/ckpt.220.pth VIDEO_OPTION [\"disk\"] TASK_CONFIG.SIMULATOR.USE_RENDERED_OBSERVATIONS False TASK_CONFIG.TASK.SENSORS [\"POINTGOAL_WITH_GPS_COMPASS_SENSOR\",\"SPECTROGRAM_SENSOR\",\"AUDIOGOAL_SENSOR\"] SENSORS [\"RGB_SENSOR\",\"DEPTH_SENSOR\"] EXTRA_RGB True TASK_CONFIG.SIMULATOR.CONTINUOUS_VIEW_CHANGE True DISPLAY_RESOLUTION 512 TEST_EPISODE_COUNT 1
```
5. Interactive demo
```
python scripts/interactive_demo.py
```

## Data
We provide acoustically realistic audio renderings for Replica and Matterport3D datasets.
The audio renderings exist in the form of pre-rendered room impulse responses (RIR), which allows
users to convolve with any source sounds they wish during training.
See [dataset](soundspaces/README.md) for more details.
Note that we do not open source the rendering code at this time.
